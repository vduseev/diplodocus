# This is a concept of a single level MAIN menu
# Notice how it has no parent field
# 
# Concept 1:
# 1. No YAML menus at all
# 2. Menu is reconstructed from the hierarchy of pages
# 3. Each page then specifies a parent page
# 4. Empty pages are pre-created by Diplodocus
#    a) store them in the template somehow
#    b) write a plugin that creates these pages
#    c) wrap jekyll into a diplodocus executable
#
# Concept 2:
# 1. YAML menus define the overall hierarchy of documentation
# 2. Menus are stored in a hierarchical fashion in directories
# 3. Pages are expected to mirror that hierarchy
# 4. No need to define URLs because structures are mirrored
#
# Concept 3:
# 1. YAML menus define overall hierarchy of documentation
# 2. Menus are stored in a hierarchical fashion in subdirectories
# 3. Pages are stored in whatever fashion user desires
# 4. Individual menus:
#    a) Menus don't have parent field (it is determined by hierarchy)
#    b) Each menu has a title field (rendered at the top)
#    d) Each item in the items list points to the menu
#       Option 1: Full path to that menu item
#       Option 2: Unique identified of the menu
#       Option 3: Hierarchically reconstructed id, where only name
#       of the menu is specified, but its path is reconstructed.
#       Note: Can't include top level menus this way!
#    c) Each menu has a URL field which points to the actual page
#    e) What if menu structure is determined entirely by directories???
#       That would be good, because otherwise we are repeating menu paths
#       twice.
#       Also you can put a menu item with whatever URL you want inside the
#       directory.
# 5. Each directory in the menus has an index.yml file 

title: Home
url: /index.html
