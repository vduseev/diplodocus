# Main menu of any Diplodocus based documentation
#
# Theorizing on menu format:
# 1. Menus should be in the "menus" dir, not "menu" dir [done]
# 2. Any menu has 3 levels at max
# 3. Every page has a menu linked to it in the frontmatter
# 4. If menu has a "parent" item, them "< Parent" top item is rendered
# 5. Links without .html
# 6. Relative links concept
#    a) Each menu item has a permalink (i.e. "business-requirements")
#    b) Each page also has a permalink 
# 7. If menu item has no url, then it is not clickable
# 8. If the url points to an unexisting page, then menu item is not displayed
