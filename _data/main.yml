# Main menu of any Diplodocus based documentation
#
# Theorizing on menu format:
# 1. Menus should be in the "menus" dir, not "menu" dir [done]
# 2. Any menu has 3 levels at max OR every menu has a single level
# 3. Every page has a menu linked to it in the frontmatter
# 4. If menu has a "parent" item, them "< Parent" top item is rendered
# 5. Links without .html
# 6. Relative links concept
#    a) Each menu item has a url (i.e. "business-requirements")
#    b) Each page also has a url 
#    c) Permalink of menu is constructed by concatenation with its parents
#    d) Permalink of page is constructed based on its location OR
#       Permalink of page is constructed based on menu item (somehow)
# 7. If menu item has no url, then it is not clickable
# 8. If the url points to an unexisting page, then menu item is not displayed
# 9. What if menu is constructed automatically out of pages? Still, some guidance would be required. Isn't that what Diplodocus is about?
# 10. Add an option to _config to render empty menu items
